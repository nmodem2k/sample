Always be careful before buying a domain name. It’s not as easy as it looks, you can’t steal the name of a business or company and buy their domain names because company names are registered and trademarked. You cannot buy a domain name that is similar to someone’s name like Adele, LEGO, and Kodak etc.  Do you know of a famous author or celebrity? Even if it available, never buy a domain with that name because this could land you directly to court as well.
