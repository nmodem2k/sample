>Deploying a site statically provides significant performance and security benefits over traditional hosting. To demonstrate this we’ll go from a standard WordPress installation to a site that’s deployed statically to Workers Sites in 194 cities around the world. 

>During this stream, Workers Developer Experience Manager Ashley Williams (@ag_dubs) and Workers Developer Advocate Kristian Freeman (@signalnerve) will introduce to you to Cloudflare Workers, and using the WordPress plugin WP2Static, export a static version of a WordPress website. Using Workers Sites, Ashley and Kristian show how to deploy that Wordpress site to Cloudflare Workers, solving a host of performance and security problems common to WordPress installations.
